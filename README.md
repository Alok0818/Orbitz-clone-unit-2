 # Orbitz_Website_Clone

<p>
      This is clone of Orbitz.com, where we have used HTML, CSS and Javascript
      to acheive this. In this project we have tried to clone the “Orbitz”
      website. We had build up all our efforts to do our best in this project.
      As, the Masai School's Mentorship was specifically to build up our skills
      and we also accordingly implemented all that teachings in our project to
      look it at its best.
